# MyDecisionHelper
A basic Android application created to help with everyday simple decision making

Allows users to input choices and randomly outputs a decision.

### Created for learning Android Studio (and my personal random decision making :) !)

Tested on OnePlus 5T running Android 9.0, built for Android 7.0
